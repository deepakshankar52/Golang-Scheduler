# Project Setup Instructions

## Backend (Go Server)

1. Navigate to the `Mail-Backend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd Mail-Backend
    ```

2. Start the Go server:
    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```

## Frontend (Vue.js)

1. Navigate to the `file-frontend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd file-frontend
    ```

2. Run the Vue frontend:
    ```bash
    npm run serve
    ```

By following these steps, your Go server should be running on `localhost:8080`, and your Vue frontend should be running on `localhost:8081`.
